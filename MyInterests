What interests me about Computer Science is how much you can do by just typing words in a computer. 
One of the things I enjoy is games, and having the knowledge to make my own games makes me excited for what I can build with my own two hands. 
I really want to learn to make softwares, websites, and especially games.
It excites me learning about ways to solve issues that a computer can do, sometimes automatically and quickly.
And I really believe that it is a blessing and a curse that a program does EXACTLY what you tell it to do.
Anyways, I am glad to be in Computer Science and I hope to learn more about this field and how I can help innovate it.
